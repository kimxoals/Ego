Each node will have randomized tendency to consume electricity generated when the node gets created.



Front-end <-> Back-end (State-Change)

Clock based
1. Time-Price distribution updates every day at 00:00
2. Time-Power graph updates every time tick(e.g 30 min)

Variable based
Graph: new node, new edge

Todo: Add graph and edge

Node
    id
    price sensitivity: random float (0<r<1)
    Time-Power distribution: math.import rNorm(rand, rand, rand)
Edge
    id = (node1_id , node2_id)
    weight = power cable limit

Time(fixed)-Power graph: updates daily at 00:00
Real-Time-Power graph: updates every clock tick

Think about drawing later.
First focus on making react components
